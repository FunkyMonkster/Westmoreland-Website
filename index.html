        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I’m a college student wandering through this thing we call life in the hopes of making any sense of it. I’ll let you know when I do. In the meantime, I’m a freelance web developer in the Kernersville, NC area. I’ve been learning the concepts of design and coding since my early days in high-school. All totaled, that’s about eight years of learning and experimenting with design and programming. After taking a break from college, I’m finally ready to finish my education and become a master full-stack developer. I specialize in design, HTML, and CSS. However, I’m looking to expand my horizons into JavaScript, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and more. Keep an eye on this site because it will be my playground to explore each new language as I learn. When I’m not updating this site, you can find me drinking coffee, playing with my dog, or trying to figure out what it means to be an adult. Seriously though, if you know how to adult, let me know. I’m really confused right now.</p>
